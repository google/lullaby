The shader_pipeline is a tool for building redux shader files.

Redux shaders are precompiled vertex and fragment shaders that are used for
rendering. Each .rxshader binary contains multiple variants of the individual
shaders as well as metadata about the properties, features, and conditions
under which each variant will be applied.
