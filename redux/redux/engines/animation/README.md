At its most basic, the AnimationEngine is responsible for updating floating
point values over time using splines. The AnimationEngine builds upon this core
functionality to implement skeletal animations using rxanim files (which can be
created using the anim_pipeline).

This engine is a heavily modified version of the Motive animation engine
(www.github.com/google/motive).
