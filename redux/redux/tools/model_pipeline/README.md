The model_pipeline is a tool for building redux model files.

A model file contains two main pieces of data: shape and material. This data can
then by used at runtime to provide physical and visual elements for an Entity.

The pipeline converts data created from digitial content creation (dcc) tools
such as Maya FBX files or Khronos GLTF files into .rxmodel files that can be
consumed efficiently by the redux runtime.
